# Dinner and a Movie
A front-end application to find a recipe and movie recommendation.

# User Story
As an end user, I would like to select my diet/preference specification(s) and receive a recipe recommendation. I'd also like to select my film genre preference(s) and receive a film recommendation.

# Concept
Our mission is to provide you suggestions for a perfect evening in! Oftentimes, the decision-making aspect of cooking can make things daunting or unappealing. Our application aims to simplify the process by allowing the user to input their prefereances and receive a singular recipe suggestion. Choosing a movie to watch alongside dinner can be equally as stressful, and our application aims to aid with that decision as well. Overall, our intent is to simplify and streamline the dinner and a movie expereince.

# How to Use
The application is being hosted on GitHub pages here:
https://aaron-ross-sanchez.github.io/recipe-finder/

First, choose your dinner preferences under the 'Recipe Generator' section. You can include as many specifications as you'd like, but need at least one specification. Hit generate and your recommedation will generate below. Each recipe recommendation will include ingredients, instructions, calories per serving and a URL link with more information.

Next, in the "Movie Preference" section, choose the movie genre(s) you'd like to watch alongside your meal. Hit the 'Generate' button and we'll provide you with your movie recommendation below! Each suggestion will come with a description and TMDB (The Movie Database) user rating. You can receive a new recommendation by hitting the 'Generate' butotn again. Finally, you can go back to your last movie recommendation by hitting the 'Load Last Film Recommendation' button at the bottom of the page.

Cheers!
